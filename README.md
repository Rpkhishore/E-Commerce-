🛒 SQL Project: ShopZone – E-Commerce Database Management
📘 Project Overview
ShopZone is a mini e-commerce database project built using MySQL. It simulates an online shopping platform's backend operations like managing products, customers, orders, payments, and more.

The project helps in understanding database design, relationships between tables, and applying real-world SQL queries for data analysis and reporting.

🧱 Project Goals
Design a relational database schema for an online shopping system.

Create and manage multiple related tables (like Customers, Orders, Products).

Generate fake but realistic data using SQL insert scripts.

Execute 20+ real-world queries to derive insights and analytics.

Understand foreign key relationships, JOINs, and aggregate functions in MySQL.

🗂️ Tables Created
Table Name	Description
Customers	Stores customer personal and contact info
Categories	Holds product category names
Products	Stores details of each product
Orders	Stores orders placed by customers
OrderItems	Line items (product quantity, price) in orders
Payments	Tracks payment details for each order

🔢 Sample Dataset
✅ 10 Categories

✅ 20 Products across categories

✅ 10 Customers from different cities

✅ 10 Orders and 25 Order Items

✅ 10 Payments using multiple payment methods

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Database: MySQL (v8.x)
